<h1>How domains, IP addresses and servers works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-domains-ip-addresses-and-servers-works" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I'm going to walk you through <em>how part of the internet works</em> as simply as possible.</p>
<div class="section" id="domains">
<h2>Domains<a class="headerlink" href="#domains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>How does it happen, that someone type <a class="reference external" href="example.com">example.com</a> and then see some
web pages? Where this <em>example.com</em> come from?</p>
<p>A little background. On internet we have IP addresses to give every
computer it's specific name. Because we don't like these awful numbers
(like 123.28.13.234), we have nicknames for them - <strong>domains</strong>. For example - you
know that when you type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">google.com</span></code>, you get to google page. But
that happens even if you type: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">74.125.224.72</span></code>. In first example it does
this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>It takes name <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">google.com</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Goes to world data bank of domains and their appropriate IP addresses</p></li>
<li><p>Find out which IP address belongs to this name <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">google.com</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>Get you to this IP address</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can <a class="reference external" href="http://www.godaddy.com/">buy</a> your own domain and then
redirect it to your IP address. Redirecting is made by adding  <strong>A record</strong>. This is usually done on their administration website. Then, after few minutes (or hours), it is registered in this world data bank.</p>
<p>There is also free alternative, for example <a class="reference external" href="http://freeavailabledomains.com/">freeavailabledomains.com</a>. It's not <strong>second-level</strong> domain (the one which is right before <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.com</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.eu</span></code>...) , but <strong>third-level</strong> (e.g. yourname.flu.cc, ...). You can use it in our example - just register there and choose your domain name (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mojepks.flu.cc</span></code>). Then you add <strong>name</strong> (that's prefix before <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.flu.cc</span></code> - in my case <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mojepks</span></code>) and <strong>destination</strong> - that's your <strong>public</strong> IP address.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="public-ip">
<h2>Public IP<a class="headerlink" href="#public-ip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What is public IP address? It means that this address is one on the whole internet - it points to one specific place on the world.</p>
<p>if you are connected to some network, for example to your home router, you have one internal network. Usually it's something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.0.xxx</span></code>. But this is not an address people can see you from the internet. It's just the internal one. On Linux you can find it by typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">ip</span> <span class="n">addr</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to find your public IP address, you can find it e.g. <a class="reference external" href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/">here</a>. But this address is most probably isn't of your PC, but of the router you have. And not even that - it might be and IP address of some other <em>node</em> to which your router is connected to. To find this out is best to ask your administrator or IPS  (a company, which is offering you and internet).</p>
<p>It means, unfortunately, that not every one has it's own &quot;public&quot; IP address and
even worse, it can change! And that is not what you want - then you
should have had to change it every time your IP get changed. You have to
ask to your IPS if your
address is &quot;static&quot; or &quot;dynamic&quot;. My IPS (UPC CZ) told me that my is
&quot;dynamic&quot;. But after a little research I found out that it means that my
IP address can <em>theoretically</em> change. In real, it is same for few years
now :) . It is relatively common, so maybe you are lucky.</p>
<p>If you don't want to buy &quot;first level domains&quot; (the one which are just
something.com) and second level is enough (like
something.somethingelse.com), then you can take a look on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.getfreedomain.name/">getfreedomain</a>. It will serve good for our purposes.</p>
